## Introduction
This project involves the creation of a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The aim of this project is to demonstrate the integration of these three fundamental web technologies.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Clear and functional user interface.
- Responsive design suitable for different screen sizes.
- Real-time calculation display.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the calculator.
- **CSS3**: For styling the calculator and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the calculator's functionality.
